        <h1>Easy on me</h1>
        <p>There ain't no gold in this river That I've been washing my hands in forever 
            I know there is hope in these waters But I can't bring myself to swim 
            When I am drowning in the silence Baby, let me in</p>
        <p>Go easy on me, baby I was still a child Didn't get the chance to 
            Feel the world around me I had no time to choose what 
            I chose to do So go easy on me </p>
        <p>There ain't no room for a thing to change When we are both so deeply stuck 
            in our ways You can't deny how hard I've tried 
            I've changed who I was to put you both first But now I givе up </p>
        <p>Go easy on me, baby I was still a child 
            Didn't get thе chance to Feel the world around me 
            Had no time to choose what I chose to do 
            So go easy on me</p>
        <p>I had good intentions And I had these hopes 
            But I know it now It probably hasn't even shown</p>
        <p>Go easy on me, baby I was still a child 
            I didn't get the chance to Feel the world around me 
            I had no time to choose what I chose to do So go easy on me</p>
